# regex-tester-tool
A Java Swing UI that allows you to build and analyze your Regular expressions.

Type in a Regex pattern in the upper text area, and a string of one or 
more lines in the lower text area, and performs various regex functions: find, matches, lookingAt, split, and replace.

When you move the cursor to a group parenthesis, it highlights the locations in the character string corresponding to that group.

Supports dot all, multiline, comments, etc compilation flags.
Supports named capture groups, and forward and back references.
