# regex-tester-tool
This tool is a Java Swing UI that allows you to type in a Regular Expression pattern in the upper text area, and a string of one or 
more lines in the lower text area, and performs various regex functions: find, matches, lookingAt, split, and replace.
When you move the cursor to a group parenthesis, it highlights the locations in the character string corresponding to that group.

Supports dot all, multiline, comments, etc compilation flags.
